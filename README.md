# grid

Next Priorities:
    Implement chunk tracking
        Have a function that translate Vector2i (and maybe higher) coordinates into strings so chunks can be organized by name
    Implement basis vectors (in terms of individual tiles)
    Implement chunk boundary transition mappings
        Maybe allow autogen for simple chunk shapes
    Implement validation for manually-added chunks
        Like standardized tile and chunk sizes
